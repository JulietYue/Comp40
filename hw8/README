We received help from the wonderful comp 40 staff

To the best of our knowledge, we have successfully implemented a
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator in UM Assembly (UMASM).
We implemented 4 modules:
        urt0: initializes our program
        main: executes our program
      printd: prints the value stack
      calc40: performs calculator operations

We used Norman Ramsey's calling conventions where:
        r0: is zero
        r1: is the return address/(value)
        r2: is the stack pointer
        r3: non volatile register (must restore if used)
        r4: non volatile register
        r5: volatile register
        r6: temporary register
        r7: temporary register

We implemented the print module by iteratively building a stack of 32 digits
and then printing the digits by popping from the stack and only outputting
digits after the last leading zero.

We spent approximately 3 hours analyzing the problem.
We spent approximately 10 hours writing assembly code.
We spent approximately 2 hours debugging our calculator.

Thank you Noah and all the TAs! COMP 40 was a fun experience
and amazing course because of you guys! :D
